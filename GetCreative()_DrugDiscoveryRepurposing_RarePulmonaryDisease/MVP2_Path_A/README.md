## MVP2 Path A

The purpose of the proposed MVP2 Path A workflow query is to leverage causal activity models (CAMs) as a source of mechanistic insights to explain clinical observations. The basic idea is to create one or more two-hop MVP2 queries, with the first hop asking for clinical observations from the clinical KPs (icees-kg, cohd, multiomics-ehr-risk-kp) and the second hop asking cam-kp for biological mechanisms to explain those observations. The demonstration query asks for chemical entities associated with disease diagnoses in the real world and then asks for genes or gene products that are affected by those chemicals. This example may seem simplistic and not terribly novel; however, cam-kp contains CAM representations that provide knowledge on entities and processes such as Gene - actively_involved_with - BiologicalProcess, so we should be able to leverage unique sources of knowledge. Caveat: cam-kp currently does not support qualifiers, but we expect to correct the underlying issue within the next week or two. 

Note that the demonstration query, while valid TRAPI, does not return results when sent to the WFR, even when Aragorn, icees-kg, and cam-kp are specifically targeted, because of timeout issues. Max W. was able to run the query only because he was able to tune Aragorn from behind-the-scenes. When sent directly to Aragorn with an extended timeout, the query returns a 16.6MB response, with >12k results in total. ICEES-KG took 35 seconds to respond to the first hop (normal timeout is 10s) and returned 106 results, and then CAM-KP took 90 seconds to respond with the 12k results. As with the MVP1 workflow queries, we may need to cache the MVP2 Path A query Aragorn in order to contribute to the MVP2 queries.
