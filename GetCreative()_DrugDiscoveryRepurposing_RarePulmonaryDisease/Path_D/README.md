## Path D

The intent of this path is to simplify the original plan for the TCDC CARA by invoking a "knowledge_type:inferred" or "get_creative" MVP1 query that asks for drugs that may treat cystic fibrosis and asthma? The query is structured as a one-hop lookup designed to leverage the clinical KPs and bubble up clinical evidence to the ARS in support of O&O.
