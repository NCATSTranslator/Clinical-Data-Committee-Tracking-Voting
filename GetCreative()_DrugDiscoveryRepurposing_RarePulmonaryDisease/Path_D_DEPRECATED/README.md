## Path D

The intent of this path is to simplify the original plan for the SRI CQS by invoking a "knowledge_type:inferred" or "get_creative" query that asks for drugs that are associated with cystic fibrosis and asthma. The query will be used for CQS development purposes, _not_ in support of MVP1 or the O&O/UI efforts.
