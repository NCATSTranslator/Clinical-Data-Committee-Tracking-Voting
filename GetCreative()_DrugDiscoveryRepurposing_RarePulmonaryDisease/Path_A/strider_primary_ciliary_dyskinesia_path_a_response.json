Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, a transmembrane ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mutations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the CFTR protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes.[A20298, A20299] As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.[A20302] Lumacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by aiding the conformational stability of F508del-mutated CFTR proteins, preventing misfolding and resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface.     Results from clinical trials indicated that treatment with Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms.[FDA Label] This data has been heavily scrutinized, however, with clinical trials showing only modest improvements despite a hefty yearly cost of $259,000 for Orkambi.[A20343] Improvements in lung function (ppFEV1) were found to be statistically significant, but minimal, with only a 2.6-3.0% change from baseline with more than 70% of patients failing to achieve an absolute improvement of at least 5%.[A20343, L936]    A wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR, or delta-F508 (Î”F508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes.[A20301] When used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi, lumacaftor is specific for the management of CF in patients with delta-F508 mutations as it acts as a protein-folding chaperone, aiding the conformational stability of the mutated CFTR protein. Consequently, lumacaftor increases successful production of CFTR ion channels and the total number of receptors available for use at the cell membrane for fluid and ion transport.[A18395] The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide, is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered.[A17564] Treatment of patients with G551D and other rarer missense mutations is usually managed with [DB08820] (Kalydeco), as it aids with altered gating mechanisms by potentiating channel opening probability of CFTR protein.    Prior to the development of lumacaftor and [DB08820] (Kalydeco), management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process. Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by Health Canada in January 2016, Orkambi was the first combination product approved for the management of Cystic Fibrosis with delta-F508 mutations.    Ivacaftor is manufactured and distributed by Vertex

It is widely used in the treatment of various heart conditions, namely atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and congestive heart failure that cannot be controlled by other medication. Digoxin preparations are commonly marketed under the trade name Lanoxin. Digoxin has positive inotropic and negative chronotropic activity. It is used to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and in the management of congestive heart failure with atrial fibrillation. Its use in congestive heart failure and sinus rhythm is less certain. The margin between toxic and therapeutic doses is small. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p666) -- Pubchem; Digoxin is a cardiotonic glycoside obtained mainly from Digitalis lanata; It consists of three sugars and the aglycone digoxigenin. Digoxin binds to a site on the extracellular aspect of the of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in the membranes of heart cells (myocytes). This causes an increase in the level of sodium ions in the myocytes, which then leads to a rise in the level of calcium ions. The proposed mechanism is the following: inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump leads to increased Na+ levels, which in turn slows down the extrusion of Ca2+ via the Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump. Increased amounts of Ca2+ are then stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and released by each action potential, which is unchanged by digoxin. This is a different mechanism from that of catecholamines. -- Wikipedia; Owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity), side effects of digoxin are inevitable. Nausea, vomiting and GIT upset are common, especially in higher doses. Decreased conduction in the AV node can lead to AV blocks, increased intracellular Ca2+ causes a type of arrhythmia called bigeminy (coupled beats), eventually ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. An often described but rarely seen side effect of digoxin is a disturbance of color vision (mostly yellow and green color) called xanthopsia.","value_type_id":"metatype:String"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","value":["INCHIKEY:LTMHDMANZUZIPE-PUGKRICDSA-N","NDDF:000593","PDQ:CDR0000485249","UMLS:C0012265","GTOPDB:4726","DRUGBANK:DB00390","CAS:20830-75-5","KEGG.DRUG:D00298","DrugCentral:882","CHEBI:4551","KEGG.COMPOUND:C06956","UNII:73K4184T59","GTOPDB:4725","RXNORM:3407","ATC:C01AA05","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1751","PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:2724385","NCIT:C28990","HMDB:HMDB0001917","MESH:D004077"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."}]},"PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:68841":{"categories":["biolink:Drug"],"name":"Phosphoserine","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","value":["MESH:D010768","UMLS:C5418344","MESH:C046162","KEGG.COMPOUND:C01005","CAS:7331-08-0","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL284377","INCHIKEY:BZQFBWGGLXLEPQ-REOHCLBHSA-N","PathWhiz.Compound:186","UMLS:C0624910","NCIT:C169894","HMDB:HMDB0000272","UNII:VI4F0K069V","CAS:17885-08-4","DRUGBANK:DB04522","CAS:407-41-0","GTOPDB:1411","PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:68841","CHEBI:15811","DrugCentral:4120","NCIT:C118883"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","value":["biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","value":["O-phospho-L-serine","phosphoserine","Dexfosfoserine","Phosphoserine","O-Phospho-L-serine","plasmenylserine","DEXFOSFOSERINE"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","value":["PMID:19212411","PMID:7738999","PMID:30143366","PMID:29457794","PMID:17485504","PMID:17417631","PMID:15801843","PMID:10888329","PMID:15745821","PMID:18579783"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","value":"The phosphoric acid ester of serine.

It is used mainly for the treatment of breast, ovarian, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel binds to microtubules reversibly with high affinity and has a maximum stoichiometry of 1 mole docetaxel per mole tubulin in microtubules. Docetaxel has been FDA-approved to treat patients who have locally advanced, or metastatic breast, or non-small-cell lung cancer who have undergone anthracycline-based chemotherapy and failed to stop cancer progression or relapsed. Docetaxel has a European approval for use in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Docetaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent and is a cytotoxic compound. It is effectively a biologically damaging drug. As with all chemotherapy, adverse effects are common and many varying side-effects have been documented. Because docetaxel is a cell-cycle specific agent, it is cytotoxic to all dividing cells in the body. This includes tumour cells as well as hair follicles, bone marrow, and other germ cells. For this reason, common chemotherapy side effects such as alopecia occur (this can sometimes be permanent). The drug company Sanofi Aventis claims that they do not routinely keep this data. A survey being conducted in northwest France aims to establish exactly how many patients are being disfigured in this way. Independent studies show it could be as high as 6.3% which puts this ASE in the 'common and frequent' classification. Docetaxel is mainly metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 subfamilies of isoenzymes. Metabolism is principally oxidative and at the tert-butylpropionate side chain, resulting first in an alcohol docetaxel (M2), which is then cyclized to three further metabolites (M1, M3, and M4). M1 and M3 are two diastereomeric hydroxyoxazolidinones and M4 is an oxazolidinedione. Phase II trials of 577 patients showed that docetaxel clearance is related to body surface area and plasma levels of hepatic enzyme alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Docetaxel is of the chemotherapy drug class taxane and is a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel (Taxol), an extract from the bark of the rare Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Due to the scarcity of paclitaxel, extensive research was carried out which lead to the formulation of docetaxel, an esterified product of 10-deacetylbaccatin III. It was extracted from the renewable and readily available European yew tree. Drug interactions may be the result of altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics due to one of the drugs involved. Cisplatin, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, etoposide, and vinblastine are all potentially co-administered with docetaxel and did not modify docetaxel plasma binding in phase II studies. Cisplatin is known to have a complex interaction with some CYPs and has, in some events, been shown to reduce docetaxel clearance by up to 25%. Anticonvulsants induce some metabolic pathways relevant to docetaxel. CYP450 and CYP3A show increased expression in response to the use of anticonvulsants and the metabolism of docetaxel metabolite M4 is processed by these CYPs. A corresponding increase in clearance of M4 by 25% is observed in patients taking phenytoin and phenobarbital, common anticonvulsants. STAMPEDE is a UK-based six-arm, five-stage, open-label randomized controlled trial involving more than 3000 men. Arms C and E of this trial involve administering docetaxel to men starting long-term hormone therapy for the first time. This could be newly diagnosed metastatic, non-metastatic, or high-risk, previously-treated prostate cancer. The trial tests the value of the drug earlier in the treatment pathway instead of waiting until it has become androgen-independent.","value_type_id":"metatype:String"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","value":["NDDF:005188","HMDB:HMDB0015378","NDDF:005187","DrugCentral:939","KEGG.DRUG:D02165","ATC:L01CD02","PDQ:CDR0000041657","INCHIKEY:ZDZOTLJHXYCWBA-VCVYQWHSSA-N","UMLS:C0246415","KEGG.COMPOUND:C11231","CAS:114977-28-5","GTOPDB:6809","CHEBI:4672","NCIT:C1526","UNII:699121PHCA","CAS:114915-20-7","PathWhiz.Compound:9655","PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:148124","RXNORM:72962","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL92","DRUGBANK:DB01248","MESH:D000077143","KEGG.DRUG:D07866","UMLS:C0771375","RXNORM:1299922","NCIT:C61734"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","description":"Identifiers

response. Its synthetic counterpart hydrocortisone is used, either as an injection or topically, in the treatment of inflammation, allergy, collagen diseases, asthma, adrenocortical deficiency, shock, and some neoplastic conditions. Hydrocortisone is synthesized from pregnenolone and is used as an immunosuppressive drug given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients who need steroid treatment but cannot take oral medication, and peri-operatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an Addisonian crisis. Cortisol increases blood pressure, blood sugar levels, may cause infertility in women, and suppresses the immune system. The amount of cortisol present in the serum undergoes diurnal variation, with the highest levels present in the early morning and lower levels in the evening, several hours after the onset of sleep. Cortisol is found to be associated with ACTH deficiency and glucocorticoid deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism. Cortisol binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor, the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA-bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically, glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes and prevents phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are inhibited by the action of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the escape of lipocortin-1 into the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines, etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages, and mastocytes. Additionally, the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.","value_type_id":"metatype:String"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","value":["PMID:11413487","PMID:2970549","PMID:29729985","PMID:18666772","PMID:2031862","PMID:24128814","PMID:19256501","PMID:27692996","PMID:30419492","PMID:18289853"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie"}]},"PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:5311101":{"categories":["biolink:ChemicalEntityOrGeneOrGeneProduct","biolink:NamedThing","biolink:ChemicalOrDrugOrTreatment","biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:MolecularEntity","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:ChemicalEntityOrProteinOrPolypeptide","biolink:Entity","biolink:PhysicalEssence","biolink:PhysicalEssenceOrOccurrent"],"name":"Fluticasone","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"EDAM:data_0954","value":"(OMOP:1149380)-[OMOP Map]-(MESH:D000068298)-[SRI Node Norm]-(PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:5311101)","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0954","original_attribute_name":"Database cross-mapping","attribute_source":"infores:cohd","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"EDAM:data_1087","value":"OMOP:1149380","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_1087","original_attribute_name":"concept_id","value_url":"https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/1149380","attribute_source":"infores:omop-ohdsi"},{"attribute_type_id":"EDAM:data_2339","value":"fluticasone","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_2339","original_attribute_name":"concept_name","attribute_source":"infores:omop-ohdsi"},{"attribute_type_id":"EDAM:data_0967","value":"Drug","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0967","original_attribute_name":"domain","attribute_source":"infores:omop-ohdsi"}]}]},"PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:5291":{"categories":["biolink:Drug"],"name":"Imatinib","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","value":["HMDB:HMDB0014757","DRUGBANK:DB00619","NCIT:C62035","INCHIKEY:KTUFNOKKBVMGRW-UHFFFAOYSA-N","DrugCentral:1423","MESH:C097613","KEGG.DRUG:D01441","CHEBI:45783","GTOPDB:5687","UNII:BKJ8M8G5HI","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL941","UMLS:C0935989","KEGG.DRUG:D08066","NDDF:009151","PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:5291","RXNORM:282388","PathWhiz.Compound:9107","ATC:L01EA01"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","value":["biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","value":["imatinib","Imatinib mesylate (USAN)","STI-571","IMATINIB","Imatinib","Imatinib (INN)"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","value":"An antineoplastic agent that inhibits the Bcr-Abl fusion protein tyrosine kinase, an abnormal enzyme produced by chronic myeloid leukemia cells that contain the Philadelphia chromosome.

It is used to treat certain bacterial infections, most often bacteria causing middle ear infections, tonsillitis, throat infections, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis. It is also effective against certain sexually transmitted infectious diseases, such as non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis. Like other macrolide antibiotics, azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial 70S ribosome. Binding inhibits peptidyl transferase activity and interferes with amino acid translocation during the process of translation. Its effects may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending of the organism and the drug concentration. Its long half-life, which enables once-daily dosing, and shorter administration durations is a property distinct from other macrolides. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered. Azithromycin is sold under the brand names Zithromax (\"Zmax\") and Sumamed, and is one of the world's best-selling antibiotics.","value_type_id":"metatype:String"}]},"NCBIGene:154":{"categories":["biolink:ChemicalEntityOrGeneOrGeneProduct","biolink:NamedThing","biolink:Polypeptide","biolink:GenomicEntity","biolink:GeneProductMixin","biolink:ThingWithTaxon","biolink:GeneOrGeneProduct","biolink:OntologyClass","biolink:Gene","biolink:Protein","biolink:ChemicalEntityOrProteinOrPolypeptide","biolink:Entity","biolink:BiologicalEntity","biolink:MacromolecularMachineMixin","biolink:PhysicalEssence","biolink:PhysicalEssenceOrOccurrent"],"name":"ADRB2_HUMAN Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (sprot)","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:Attribute","value":"5q32","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0006","original_attribute_name":"location"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:symbol","value":"ADRB2","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0006","original_attribute_name":"symbol"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:Attribute","value":"protein-coding gene","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0006","original_attribute_name":"locus_group"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:Attribute","value":"10116","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0006","original_attribute_name":"NCBITaxon"},{"attribute_type_id":"dct:description","value":"A beta-2 adrenergic receptor that is encoded in the genome of human.","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0006","original_attribute_name":"description"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:same_as","value":["NCBIGene:154","ENSEMBL:ENSG00000169252","UMLS:C2976741","OMIM:109690","PR:P07550","ENSEMBL:ENSP00000305372.4","UMLS:C1367657","UniProtKB:X5DQM5","ENSEMBL:ENSP00000305372","UniProtKB:P07550","HGNC:286"],"value_type_id":"metatype:uriorcurie","original_attribute_name":"equivalent_identifiers"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:same_as","value":["UniProtKB:P07550","PR:P07550","ENSEMBL:ENSP00000305372","ENSEMBL:ENSP00000305372.4","UMLS:C2976741"],"value_type_id":"metatype:uriorcurie","original_attribute_name":"equivalent_identifiers"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:Attribute","value":"NCBITaxon:9606","value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0006","original_attribute_name":"taxon"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:Attribute","value":90.8,"value_type_id":"EDAM:data_0006","original_attribute_name":"information_content"}]},"PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:35330":{"categories":["biolink:Drug"],"name":"Bitolterol","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","value":["Bitolterol","bitolterol","Bitolterol (INN)","BITOLTEROL","bitolterol mesilate"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","value":["biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:ChemicalEntity","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","value":"A diester sympathomimetic amine with bronchodilator activity.

In its statement, the FDA has mentioned that increased risk of venous thromboembolism with oral contraceptives such as drospirenone exists but remains lower than the risk of this condition during pregnancy and during the postpartum period, and this should be considered when assessing potential risks of hormonal contraceptive use.[L7979]","value_type_id":"metatype:String"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:publications","value":["PMID:11413487","PMID:27593335","PMID:23577032","PMID:28986954","PMID:29137347","PMID:16902246","PMID:26271371","PMID:25890012","PMID:17374880","PMID:20044567"],"value_type_id":"biolink:Uriorcurie"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:xref","value":["ATC:G03AC10","PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:68873","GTOPDB:2874","NCIT:C47502","HMDB:HMDB0015467","MESH:C035144","CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1509","UMLS:C0043822","INCHIKEY:METQSPRSQINEEU-HXCATZOESA-N","KEGG.DRUG:D03917","NDDF:009133","CAS:67392-87-4","RXNORM:11636","CHEBI:50838","DRUGBANK:DB01395","UNII:N295J34A25","DrugCentral:968"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Nodeidentifier","description":"Identifiers of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:synonym","value":["drospirenone","Drospirenone (JAN/USP/INN)","dihydrospirorenone","DROSPIRENONE","Drospirenone"],"value_type_id":"metatype:String","description":"Names of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."}]},"PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:444037":{"categories":["biolink:Drug"],"name":"Roxithromycin","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","value":"A semi-synthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin that includes an N-oxime side chain on the lactone ring, with antibacterial and anti-malarial activities.

These are organic compounds containing a dialkylamine group, characterized by two alkyl groups bonded to the amino nitrogen. Abnormal bleeding, such as bleeding spontaneously or profusely from a very minor injury can also occur. Spermidine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. Within humans, spermidine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, 5'-methylthioadenosine and spermidine can be biosynthesized from S-adenosylmethioninamine and putrescine by the enzyme spermidine synthase. In addition, S-adenosylmethioninamine and spermidine can be converted into 5'-methylthioadenosine and spermine through the action of the enzyme spermine synthase. In humans, spermidine is involved in spermidine and spermine biosynthesis. Outside of the human body, spermidine is found, on average, in the highest concentration within cow milk and oats. Spermidine has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as common chokecherries, watercress, agars, strawberry guava, and bog bilberries. This could make spermidine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods. Spermidine is consideres as an uremic toxine. Increased levels of uremic toxins can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. Chronic exposure to uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. As a uremic toxin, this compound can cause uremic syndrome. Uremic toxins such as spermidine are actively transported into the kidneys via organic ion transporters (especially OAT3).","value_type_id":"metatype:String"},{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:category","value":["biolink:SmallMolecule","biolink:Drug"],"value_type_id":"metatype:Uriorcurie","description":"Categories of all nodes in this synonym set in RTX-KG2."}]},"PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:60795":{"categories":["biolink:Drug"],"name":"Aripiprazole","attributes":[{"attribute_type_id":"biolink:description","value":"Aripiprazole is a warning has gone out recently because of this drug's name.

Putrescine is related to cadaverine (another polyamine). Both are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and both are toxic in large doses. Putrescine and cadaverine are largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to the odor of such processes as bad breath and bacterial vaginosis. Putrescine has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID:22626821). It is also found in semen. Putrescine attacks s-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermidine. Spermidine in turn attacks another s-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermine. Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase. The polyamines, of which putrescine is one of the simplest, appear to be growth factors necessary for cell division. Putrescine apparently has specific role in skin physiology and neuroprotection. (PMID:15009201, 16364196). Pharmacological interventions have demonstrated convincingly that a steady supply of polyamines is a prerequisite for cell proliferation to occur. Genetic engineering of polyamine metabolism in transgenic rodents has shown that polyamines play a role in spermatogenesis, skin physiology, promotion of tumorigenesis and organ hypertrophy as well as neuronal protection. Transgenic activation of polyamine catabolism not only profoundly disturbs polyamine homeostasis in most tissues, but also creates a complex phenotype affecting skin, female fertility, fat depots, pancreatic integrity and regenerative growth.

It appears colorless to the naked eye in small quantities, though it is actually slightly blue in color. It covers 71% of Earth's surface. Current estimates suggest that there are 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (330 million m3) of it available on Earth, and it exists in many forms. It appears mostly in the oceans (saltwater) and polar ice caps, but it is also present as clouds, rain water, rivers, freshwater aquifers, lakes, and sea ice. Water in these bodies perpetually moves through a cycle of evaporation, precipitation, and runoff to the sea. Clean water is essential to human life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply. From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Water is thus essential and central to these metabolic processes. Water is also central to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration). Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as hydroxide ion (OH-) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7. Stomach acid (HCl) is useful to digestion. However, its corrosive effect on the esophagus during reflux can temporarily be neutralized by ingestion of a base such as aluminum hydroxide to produce the neutral molecules water and the salt aluminum chloride. Human biochemistry that involves enzymes usually performs optimally around a biologically neutral pH of 7.4.

These are organic compounds containing a dialkylamine group, characterized by two alkyl groups bonded to the amino nitrogen. The resultin N-carbamoylputrescine is acted on by a hydrolase to split off urea group, leaving putrescine. The precursor for synthesis of spermine is the amino acid ornithine. The intermediate is spermidine. Spermine is a drug. Spermine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. 5'-methylthioadenosine and spermine can be biosynthesized from S-adenosylmethioninamine and spermidine through its interaction with the enzyme spermine synthase. Another pathway in plants starts with decarboxylation of L-arginine to produce agmatine. In humans, spermine is involved in spermidine and spermine biosynthesis. Outside of the human body, spermine is found, on average, in the highest concentration in oats. Spermine has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as sapodilla, mexican groundcherries, cloves, sourdocks, and sunflowers. This could make spermine a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods. This decarboxylation gives putrescine. The name spermin was first used by the German chemists Ladenburg and Abel in 1888, and the correct structure of spermine was not finally established until 1926, simultaneously in England (by Dudley, Rosenheim, and Starling) and Germany (by Wrede et al.). In one pathway L-glutamine is the precursor to L-ornithine, after which the synthesis of spermine from L-ornithine follows the same pathway as in animals.

Estradiol is produced in the ovaries. The ovary requires both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to produce sex steroids. LH stimulates the cells surrounding the follicle to produce progesterone and androgens. The androgens diffuse across the basement membrane to the granulosa cell layer, where, under the action of FSH, they are aromatized to estrogens, mainly estradiol. The ovary shows cyclical activity, unlike the testis that is maintained in a more or less constant state of activity. Hormone secretions vary according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. In the developing follicle LH receptors (LH-R) are only located on the thecal cells and FSH receptors (FSHR) on the granulosa cells. The dominant pre-ovulatory follicle develops LH-Rs on the granulosa cells prior to the LH surge. Thecal cells of the preovulatory follicle also develop the capacity to synthesize estradiol and this persists when the thecal cells become incorporated into the corpus luteum. After ovulation, the empty follicle is remodelled and plays an important role in the second half or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This phase is dominated by progesterone and, to a lesser extent, estradiol secretion by the corpus luteum. estradiol is also synthesized locally from cholesterol through testosterone in the hippocampus and acts rapidly to modulate neuronal synaptic plasticity. Localization of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in spines in addition to nuclei of principal neurons implies that synaptic ERalpha is responsible for rapid modulation of synaptic plasticity by endogenous estradiol. estradiol is a potent endogenous antioxidant which suppresses hepatic fibrosis in animal models, and attenuates induction of redox sensitive transcription factors, hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation by inhibiting a generation of reactive oxygen species in primary cultures. This suggests that the greater progression of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in men and postmenopausal women may be due, at least in part, to lower production of estradiol and a reduced response to the action of estradiol. estradiol has been reported to induce the production of interferon (INF)-gamma in lymphocytes, and augments an antigen-specific primary antibody response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma is a potent cytokine with immunomodulatory and antiproliferative properties. Therefore, female subjects, particularly before menopause, may produce antibodies against hepatitis B virus e antigen and hepatitis B virus surface antigen at a higher frequency than males with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The estradiol-Dihydrotestosterone model of prostate cancer (PC) proposes that the first step in the development of most PC and breast cancer (BC) occurs when aromatase converts testosterone to estradiol.

Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.9% of the volume of air. All major classes of structural molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that comprise animal shells, teeth, and bone. Oxygen in the form of O2 is produced from water by cyanobacteria, algae and plants during photosynthesis and is used in cellular respiration for all living organisms. Green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on earth and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants. Oxygen is used in mitochondria to help generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during oxidative phosphorylation. For animals, a constant supply of oxygen is indispensable for cardiac viability and function. To meet this demand, an adult human, at rest, inhales 1.8 to 2.4 grams of oxygen per minute. This amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year. At a resting pulse rate, the heart consumes approximately 8-15 ml O2/min/100 g tissue. This is significantly more than that consumed by the brain (approximately 3 ml O2/min/100 g tissue) and can increase to more than 70 ml O2/min/100 g myocardial tissue during vigorous exercise. As a general rule, mammalian heart muscle cannot produce enough energy under anaerobic conditions to maintain essential cellular processes; thus, a constant supply of oxygen is indispensable to sustain cardiac function and viability. However, the role of oxygen and oxygen-associated processes in living systems is complex, and they and can be either beneficial or contribute to cardiac dysfunction and death (through reactive oxygen species). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a family of oxygen-derived free radicals that are produced in mammalian cells under normal and pathologic conditions. Many ROS, such as the superoxide anion (O2-)and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), act within blood vessels, altering mechanisms mediating mechanical signal transduction and autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Reactive oxygen species are believed to be involved in cellular signaling in blood vessels in both normal and pathologic states. The major pathway for the production of ROS is by way of the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to form an oxygen radical, the superoxide anion (O2-). Within the vasculature there are several enzymatic sources of O2-, including xanthine oxidase, the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and nitric oxide (NO) synthases. Studies in recent years, however, suggest that the major contributor to O2- levels in vascular cells is the membrane-bound enzyme NADPH-oxidase. Produced O2- can react with other radicals, such as NO, or spontaneously dismutate to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In cells, the latter reaction is an important pathway for normal O2- breakdown and is usually catalyzed by the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Once formed, H2O2 can undergo various reactions, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic. The antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase act to limit ROS accumulation within cells by breaking down H2O2 to H2O. Metabolism of H2O2 can also produce other, more damaging ROS. For example, the endogenous enzyme myeloperoxidase uses H2O2 as a substrate to form the highly reactive compound hypochlorous acid. Alternatively, H2O2 can undergo Fenton or Haber-Weiss chemistry, reacting with Fe2+/Fe3+ ions to form toxic hydroxyl radicals (-.OH).

The conversion of the natural C19 steroids, testosterone and androstenedione into estrone is dependent on a complex key reaction catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 aromatase (EC 1.14.14.1, unspecific monooxygenase), which is expressed in many tissues of the adult human (e.g. ovary, fat tissue), but not in the liver. The ovaries after menopause continue to produce androstenedione and testosterone in significant amounts and these androgens are converted in fat, muscle, and skin into estrone. When women between the ages of 45 and 64 years have prophylactic oophorectomy (when hysterectomy is performed for benign disease to prevent the development of ovarian cancer), evidence suggests that oophorectomy increases the subsequent risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and osteoporosis. Whereas 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer every year nearly 490,000 women die of heart disease and 48,000 women die within 1 year after hip fracture. Therefore, the decision to perform prophylactic oophorectomy should be approached with great caution for the majority of women who are at low risk of developing ovarian cancer. Steroid sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.2, STS) hydrolyzes steroid sulfates, such as estrone sulfate to estrone which can be converted to steroids with potent estrogenic properties, that is, estradiol; STS activity is much higher in breast tumors and high levels of STS mRNA expression in tumors are associated with a poor prognosis. The biological roles of estrogens in tumorigenesis are certainly different between the endometrium and breast, although both are considered \"estrogen-dependent tissues\". 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.62, 17-HSDs) are enzymes involved in the formation of active sex steroids. estrone is interconverted by two enzymes 17-HSD types. Type 1 converts estrone to estradiol and Type 2 catalyzes the reverse reaction.
