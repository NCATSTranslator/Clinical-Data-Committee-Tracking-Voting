![Alt text](docs/drugDiscoveryWorkflow.png?raw=true "Workflow")

### Potential workflow steps as illustrated in the document below


### Preliminary steps (rough draft, to be revisited)
* Assemble list of approved drug and drug targets (genes)
* Annotate each target according to the text mining and genetics data
  * For all traits
* For each target/gene, expand to other genes in the pathways linked to the traits
* Look at clinical data to look at off label effects and cross reference targets with above list

### Initial focus for use cases:
* Type 2 diabetes (t2d)
* Drug induced liver disease (DILI)
* A rare disease (TBD)
